Welcome to Python Heart Rate Analysis Toolkit's documentation!
==============================================================

Welcome to the documentation of the Python Heart Rate Analysis Toolkit. The toolkit is designed to handle (noisy) PPG data collected with either PPG or camera sensors.

The toolkit was presented at the Humanist 2018 conference in The Hague (paper link). A technical paper about the functionality is currently under review and will be posted here as soon as it's published.

The documentation will help you get up to speed quickly. Follow the :ref:`quickstart` guide for a general overview of how to use the toolkit in only a few lines of code. For a more in-depth review of the module's functionality you can refer to the papers mentioned above, or the :ref:`heart rate analysis` overview.
