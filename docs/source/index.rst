Welcome to HeartPy - Python Heart Rate Analysis Toolkit's documentation!
==============================================================

.. image:: images/output_4.jpg

Welcome to the documentation of the HeartPy, Python Heart Rate Analysis Toolkit. The toolkit is designed to handle (noisy) PPG data collected with either PPG or camera sensors.

The toolkit was presented at the Humanist 2018 conference in The Hague (`see paper here <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325967542_Heart_Rate_Analysis_for_Human_Factors_Development_and_Validation_of_an_Open_Source_Toolkit_for_Noisy_Naturalistic_Heart_Rate_Data>`_ ). 

A technical paper about the functionality [is available here](http://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.24895.56485)

**Please cite one or both of these papers when using the toolkit in your research!**

The documentation will help you get up to speed quickly. Follow the :ref:`quickstart` guide for a general overview of how to use the toolkit in only a few lines of code. For a more in-depth review of the module's functionality you can refer to the papers mentioned above, or the :ref:`heart rate analysis` overview.

Note on using it in scientific research
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Support is available at P.vanGent@tudelft.nl. When using the toolkit in your scientific work: please include me in the process. I can help you implement the toolkit, and the collaboration will also help improve the toolkit so that it can handle more types of data in the future.
