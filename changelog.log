V0.8.1
- Added changelog to repository
- Implemented clipping detection and interpolation functionality
- Changed FFT calculation flag to default False, as in some cases the FFT takes very long to compute. Possible causes and fixes to be investigated
- Pushed readthedocs.io documentation source structure to repository
- Added encoding argument to get_data function, per the NumPy deprecation of not using encoding. For more info: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.14.0/release.html#encoding-argument-for-text-io-functions

V0.8.2
- RR_difference interval no longer taken into account when RR-intervals are not technically adjacent due to rejected peak presence in between
- Moved matplotlib import statement so that it is no longer necessary unless calling the plot functionality, reduces need to install irrelevant dependencies when plotting functionality not needed
- Added Hampel Filter with settable filtersize
- Added method to suppress noisy segments called 'Hampel Corrector', called such as it's simply a Hampel Filter with large window size. Computationally on the expensive side so disabled by default, but very good at suppressing noisy segments without influencing peak positions in the rest of the signal.
- Added breathing rate extraction method. Stores estimated breathing rate in measures['breathingrate']
- Made BPM threshold values settable
